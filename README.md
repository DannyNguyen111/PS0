Introduction to SFML
The goal of this project was to get a better grasp of SFML and its various features. I was able to allow the user to change the color of the shapes/circle to change color with the 'Q' key.I decided to use the rand function to find 3 random numbers ranging from 1 to 255. The reason behind this is because the coloring of the circle is based on the RGB color model, where each parameter (red, green, and blue) requires a value between 0 and 255. I also decided to use if statements along with isKeyPressed to allow for the movement of the spirte and circle.
